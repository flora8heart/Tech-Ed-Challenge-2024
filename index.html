      <p class="justify">Hi! I'm Michelle.</p>
      <p class="justify">
        I enjoy problem solving and solving puzzles which is one of the reasons
        I am drawn towards programming and computer science. On the creative
        side, I have strong passion and love for music. I have been playing
        piano since I was five years old and I love to sing. I can play a little
        bit of guitar too but piano is my main passion.
      </p>

      <p class="justify">
        The reason why I am doing this software development course is because I
        am pursuing a career switch after a decade of a career in pharmacy and
        healthcare (nearly 6 years of working as a pharmacist, 4 years of
        pharmacy master degree and 1 year of pre-registration training).
      </p>

      <p class="justify">
        When I was 17 years old, I was at a crossroad trying to decide which
        degree to study upon the completion of my A-Levels. My interest at the
        time was pursuing a career that will utilise either a background in
        science or mathematics. I was on the fence between computer science,
        aerospace engineering or pharmacy. At the time in 2012, the IT world was
        not the way it is now and one of the fear my parents had was that
        pursuing computer science would meant that I may not have a stable
        career prospects. Being so young and naive, societal and family pressure
        meant that I was lead down the "safe" path and so I decided to pursue
        pharmacy.
      </p>
      <p class="justify">
        When I was in university for my pharmacy master degree, I always felt
        like something is missing and will seek opportunities to somehow immerse
        myself in mathematics or tech. For example, when I am learning about the
        formula for rate limiting steps during a physical pharmaceutics lecture,
        I would spend time in class figuring out how the mathematical formula is
        derived and will not stop till I was able to figure out how it is
        derived even though it is not part of the learning material.
      </p>
      <p class="justify">
        I remember vividly during my final year project, I was getting
        frustrated with keeping track of multiple versions of my file document
        as naming files as "final_project_v2.docx", "final_project_FINAL.docx",
        "final_project_FINAL_FINAL.docx" is getting out of hand and was an
        inefficient method to keep track of which is the most recent version of
        my file.
      </p>

      <p class="justify">
        Thus I set out to figure out a way to solve this problem and this is how
        I came across Git and thought this will be a great tool to use for
        version control for my final year project. From here, I learned about
        markdown and saved my document in markdown format, I also came across
        Bibtex for academic referencing and learned to use pandoc for final
        output of my document in PDF or DOCX format for final submission. I was
        very proud of myself for figuring this out was able to find a little joy
        in my degree despite it not being my first choice.
      </p>
      <p class="justify">
        After graduating from university, I continued down the path of
        practicing as a pharmacist. Now in 2024, I feel complete in what I have
        achieved as a pharmacist and I decided that it is time to pursue the
        other passion I had when I was 17 which is programming thus why I was
        drawn towards this course. I look forward to meeting other liked-minded
        people at the bootcamp and looking forward to learning and working with
        others in a collaborative environment.
