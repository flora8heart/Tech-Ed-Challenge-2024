      <p class="justify">Hi! I'm Michelle.</p>
      <p class="justify">
        I enjoy problem-solving and solving puzzles, which is one of the reasons
        I am drawn towards programming and computer science. On the creative
        side, I have a strong passion and love for music. I have been playing
        piano since I was five and I love to sing. I can play a little bit of
        guitar too, but piano has always been my main passion.
      </p>

      <p class="justify">
        The reason I am doing this software development course is because I am
        pursuing a career switch after a decade in the pharmacy and healthcare
        sector. This includes nearly 6 years of working as a pharmacist, 4 years
        of pharmacy master's degree and 1 year of pre-registration training.
      </p>

      <p class="justify">
        When I was 17 years old, I was at a crossroad trying to decide which
        degree to study upon the completion of my A-Levels studies. My interest
        at the time was pursuing a career that will utilise either a background
        in science or mathematics. I was on the fence between computer science,
        aerospace engineering or pharmacy. At the time in 2012, the IT world was
        not the way it is now and one of the fears my parents had was that
        pursuing computer science would mean that I may not have a stable career
        prospects. Being so young and naive, societal and family pressure meant
        that I was led down the "safe" path, and thus I decided to pursue
        pharmacy.
      </p>
      <p class="justify">
        When I was in university studying for my pharmacy master's degree, I
        always felt like something was missing and will seek opportunities to
        somehow immerse myself in mathematics or tech. For example, when I was
        learning about a rate-limiting step formula of a chemical reaction
        during a physical pharmaceutics lecture, I remember spending time in
        class figuring out how the mathematical formula was derived. I did not
        stop until I was able to figure out how it was derived even though it is
        not part of the learning material and thoroughly enjoyed the process.
      </p>
      <p class="justify">
        During my final year project, I remembered vividly that I was getting
        frustrated with keeping track of multiple versions of my file documents.
        I was making multiple copies and naming these files as
        "final_project_v2.docx", "final_project_FINAL_FINAL.docx" etc.
        Eventually, I realised that this was getting out of hand and thought
        that it was an inefficient method to keep track of which was the most
        recent version of my file.
      </p>

      <p class="justify">
        Thus, I set out to figure out a way to solve this problem and this was
        how I came across Git and thought this will be a great tool to use for
        version control for my final year project. From here, I learned about
        Markdown and saved my documents in Markdown format. I also came across
        Bibtex for academic referencing and learned how to use Pandoc for final
        output of my thesis in PDF or DOCX format for final submission. I was
        very proud of myself for figuring this out, and was able to find a
        little joy in my degree despite it not being my first choice.
      </p>
      <p class="justify">
        After graduating from university, I continued down the path of
        practicing as a pharmacist. Now in 2024, I feel complete with what I
        have achieved as a pharmacist and I decided that it is time to pursue
        the other passion I had when I was seventeen, which was programming,
        thus why I was drawn towards this course. I look forward to meeting
        other liked-minded people at the bootcamp, and looking forward to
        learning and working with others in a collaborative environment.
